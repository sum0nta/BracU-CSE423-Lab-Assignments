2 Lab Assignments and a lab project, the main file contains the project.

Project Description:
The player controls a car that is placed in the center lane of a three-lane road. The vehicle can move up or down for minor modifications and left or right to change lanes. While traversing the lanes, the player must avoid crashes with oncoming cars that appear from the opposite way. Coins are scattered between the coming vehicles; normal coins increase the score, while special coins provide temporary immunity. Avoiding collisions, collecting points, and surviving as long as possible are objectives in order to earn as many points as possible.
